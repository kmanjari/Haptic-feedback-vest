# Haptic Feedback Vest for Obstacle Detection

Visit our instructable at http://www.instructables.com/id/Haptic-Feedback-Vest-for-Obstacle-Detection/ to view a description of the system breakdown!

This design utilizes a stereo camera and software (Python and SimpleCV) that parses the user's surroundings into a depth map using a Raspberry Pi platform. This depth map is then used to vibrate the vest at a particular location to signify an obstacle in that location. For example, a vibration in the upper left region of the vest would indicate a hazard in the upper-body/leftward side of the surroundings. We also developed a PCB and integrated the physical piezoelectric hardware into a vest to create a functional and wearable prototype.

Final project for EE285: Embedded Systems Workshop course at Stanford University.
